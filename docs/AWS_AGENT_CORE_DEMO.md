   - Classifies incident severity (P0-P4)
   - Determines impact scope and affected services
   - Estimates user impact and business consequences

2. **Root Cause Analysis Agent** 🔍
   - Performs automated root cause analysis
   - Analyzes logs, metrics, and system state
   - Provides evidence-based diagnosis with confidence scores

3. **Automated Remediation Agent** 🔧
   - Generates automated remediation actions
   - Assesses automation safety and risk levels
   - Creates workflow execution plans with rollback strategies

4. **Communication Agent** 📢
   - Manages stakeholder notifications
   - Creates communication templates and schedules
   - Coordinates internal and external messaging

5. **Post-Incident Analysis Agent** 📊
   - Conducts comprehensive post-mortem analysis
   - Identifies improvement opportunities
   - Generates prevention measures and lessons learned
